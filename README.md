## Intro
#### A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is an automatic transmission that can change seamlessly through a continuous range of gear ratios. This contrasts with other transmissions that provide a limited number of gear ratios in fixed steps. The flexibility of a CVT with suitable control may allow the engine to operate at a constant RPM while the vehicle moves at varying speeds (a summary from Wikipedia to introduce CVT).
#### Itâ€™s designed for a purpose of creating a full model of a new car under the supervision of Amir Taghavi Pour. The transmission part was what I had to designed and it was done by SOLIDWORK. Its components include two pullies, a steel belt, a clutch pack, a planetary gearbox (consists of internal gear, a sun gear, three planet gears, and a carrier), final drives, and a differential gearbox, and a box.
